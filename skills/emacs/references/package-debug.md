# Package Debug Workflow

Use this workflow for Emacs package development problems across agents and operating systems.

## Standard Sequence

1. Reproduce the failure in the running Emacs session.
2. Enable `debug-on-error` and, when useful, `debug-on-quit`.
3. Reload the file under development with `load-file`.
4. Inspect `*Messages*`, `*Warnings*`, and `*Backtrace*`.
5. Byte-compile the changed file to surface warnings, missing requires, obsolete APIs, or macro expansion issues.
6. Run focused ERT tests if present.
7. Inspect feature state and symbol state:
   - `featurep`
   - `fboundp`
   - `boundp`
   - current value for critical variables
8. Inspect buffer-local state, hooks, keymaps, or minor mode activation if the bug is contextual.

## Common Failure Patterns

- `void-function`: missing `require`, stale load order, or typo in generated/autoloaded symbol.
- `void-variable`: lexical binding mismatch, file not reloaded, or variable defined only in another feature.
- Hook runs but behavior is wrong: inspect hook membership and buffer-local values.
- Command exists but key does not work: inspect active maps, minor modes, and overriding maps.
- Tests pass in isolation but fail interactively: inspect persistent global state and buffer-local state left over from earlier runs.
- Byte compilation warns about free variables or unknown functions: usually indicates missing declarations or requires.

## Minimal Triage Data To Capture

- Exact error message
- Relevant `*Backtrace*` frames
- Relevant `*Messages*` lines
- File(s) reloaded
- Test command and failing test names
- Whether the issue reproduces after reloading only the changed package files
